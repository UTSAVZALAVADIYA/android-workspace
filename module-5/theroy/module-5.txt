Discuss the differences between SharedPreferences, SQLite, and Room in
Android. When would you choose each for data storage?


1)SharedPreferences 

Best for storing small key-value data, such as user settings or login details.
Ideal for simple, lightweight storage needs.
Not suitable for complex data structures or large datasets.

2)SQLite 
A full-fledged database for storing structured data.
Uses SQL queries to perform CRUD operations.
Great for managing large datasets, but requires more coding effort.

3)Room 

A high-level SQLite wrapper that simplifies database interactions.
Uses annotations and DAOs to handle data with minimal boilerplate code.
Ensures SQL queries are checked at compile-time for accuracy.
Ideal for building modern, scalable databases in Android apps.



 When would you choose each for data storage


1)SharedPreferences

Use SharedPreferences when you need to store small pieces of persistent data like user settings, app preferences, or simple state information

2)SQLite

Use SQLite when your app requires a structured database with complex queries, relationships, or transactions.

3)Room

Use Room when you need SQLiteâ€™s power but want an easier, more maintainable way to interact with the database.
